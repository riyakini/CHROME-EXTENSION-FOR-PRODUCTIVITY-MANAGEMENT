The Productivity Extension is a Google Chrome extension designed to help users stay focused by blocking distracting websites and tracking their productivity. Developed as part of my 4-week internship at CodTech IT Solutions, this project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and efficient productivity tool.


The extension provides users with an easy way to activate a "productive mode," block distracting websites, track time spent working, and monitor distractions. By offering customization options through a settings page, users can tailor their blocked websites list based on personal preferences.

This project was guided by my mentor Neela Santosh, and I completed it under my Intern ID: CT08JZR.

Key Features
✅ Popup Interface for Quick Controls
The popup menu has two main buttons:
🟢 Start – Activates the productive mode, blocking websites from the blocked list.
⚙️ Settings – Opens a new tab where users can customize their blocked websites list.
🚫 Website Blocking
By default, the extension blocks major social media sites like:
Facebook

YouTube

Twitter

LinkedIn

Instagram

Users can add or remove websites from the blocked list through the Settings page.
⏳ Productivity Timer & Distraction Counter
A count-up timer helps users track how long they have been working.
A distraction counter records how many times the user tries to access a blocked website.
🔴 Blocked Page Redirection
If the user tries to access a blocked website, they are redirected to a custom "Blocked Page" instead of the original site.
The page simply displays a warning message and allows them to return to their previous page.
🔧 Customizable Settings Page
Users can:
✅ Add more websites to block.
❌ Remove websites from the blocked list.
🛠️ Modify preferences to suit their work style.
Technologies Used
🔹 HTML – Used for structuring the extension popup and settings page.
🔹 CSS – Provides styling for a clean and modern UI.
🔹 JavaScript – Handles core functionality, including:

Fetching and updating the blocked sites list.
Monitoring user activity and tracking distractions.
Redirecting blocked websites.
Inspiration Behind the Project
While working on my college courses and other projects, I often found myself getting distracted by social media. I would open YouTube or Instagram when I was supposed to focus on my assignments.

To solve this problem, I built a Chrome extension that would block distractions and help me stay productive. By adding a timer and a distraction counter, I was able to track my focus levels and improve my time management.

This experience helped me grow as a developer, improving my skills in:
✅ JavaScript programming
✅ DOM manipulation
✅ Chrome extension development
✅ User interface design

Conclusion
The Productivity Extension is a powerful tool designed to boost productivity and reduce distractions while using Google Chrome. By blocking websites, tracking focus time, and offering customization options, it helps users stay on track and develop better work habits.
